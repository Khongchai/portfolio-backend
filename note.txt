redeploy backend on docker, and set up graphql type gen on front so that you can ask 
for the schema and use the hooks.

When user clicks on "fiery", change the bloompass's strength to 1.5 (or something similarly strong or stronger) and change the speed to faster for a few seconds.
For this, you will need to refactor wobbly into a class. Make a copy with all the params.

Some type of indicator for the user to click on the word fiery.

Make hoveredComponent shared globally (in layout/index.js)
